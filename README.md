# Ohara

This is my collection of implimention of llm,paper and things I hand in my mind
I hand lot of fragmented code of implimention of diffrent model 

this is attempt to make it eveything in one place <br>
This lib is for runing/copying code for expriments
<br>
install with
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joey00072/ohara.git
pip install -e .
```
then

```bash
## download and pretokenize
python examples/prepare-dataset.py

## train 
## look at train.py its fairly easy
python examples/train_llama.py

# lighting fabric verison is also avalible (recommanded)
python examples/train_llama_fabric.py 
```
![alt text](./docs/src/image.png)

llama-20M trained on tinystores for 1.7B

inferance on phi2
```zsh
## this will download model from hf and run it in torch.flaot16

python phi_inference.py 

## look at files and you can impliment rest of things easily, 
## I belive in you ðŸ˜‰
```


###  The lib to maximize FAFO
papaers and theory is on one side but `code is truth`, in the end things that matter that works (runs)<br>
If you look into [docs](./docs/) you can find some written things. this are mostly copied from my obsidian notes

2. [Neural Style Transfer in Pytorch](https://github.com/joey00072/Neural-Style-Transfer-in-Pytorch)



## TODO  (A lot)
- [ ] make infercer class better
- [ ] make training loop better (use lightning fabric maybe)
- [ ] Finetuning in structed way (I just rawdoag code when I need it)
- [ ] DPO 
- [ ] make is py modele so I can create expriment folder and put all this in it
